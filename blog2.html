            <h2>Home Automation</h2>
            <div class="project-details">

                <p>In this world of expensive and complicated automation systems, such as home automation, cabin automation, room automation and so on, we need a more reliable, user-friendly and more efficient system. We came up with an automation system
                    that uses raspberry pi, a mini-computer, which is more efficient rather than any microcontroller.</p>
                <p>Automation is the process of controlling appliances automatically using various system . Electrical and electronic appliances such as fans, lights, outdoor lights, doors etc. can be controlled using various control techniques. In the olden
                    days, complex circuitry used to be used for turning on the appliances. In era of advancing technology, solution for things or let’s say the complex circuitry became simple and user-friendly which led to fewer human interventions, therefore
                    we call it an automation system. To replace these things, we came up with new hardware’s which are being developed using small components of electronics and hence automating the systems.</p>
                <p>In every industry nowadays we see more work of machines than humans, this reduces cost, labour and is more secure and efficient. Once a system is automated and is maintained properly, it can be prolonged and further evolved. </p>
                <p>In this Covid Situation, such a system can help a lot for maintaining social distance. More Work and research can help to build more innovative solutions. Engineering is concerned with understanding and controlling the materials and forces
                    of nature for the benefit of humankind. Therefore there exists systems which is called smart which operate in specific conditions and also predict the suitable output hence implementing it.</p>
